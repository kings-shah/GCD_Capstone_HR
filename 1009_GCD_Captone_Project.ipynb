Introduction**\n","---\n","Your client for this project is the HR Department at a software company.\n","\n","- They want to try a new initiative to retain employees.\n","- The idea is to use data to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.\n","- Once these employees are identified, HR can be more proactive in reaching out to them before it's too late.\n","- They only want to deal with the data that is related to permanent employees.\n","\n","** Current Practice **\n","- Once an employee leaves, he or she is taken an interview with the name “exit interview” and shares reasons for leaving. The HR Department then tries and learns insights from the interview and makes changes accordingly.\n","\n","This suffers from the following problems:\n","\n","- This approach is that it's too haphazard. The quality of insight gained from an interview depends heavily on the skill of the interviewer.\n","- The second problem is these insights can't be aggregated and interlaced across all employees who have left.\n","- The third is that it is too late by the time the proposed policy changes take effect.\n","\n","The HR department has hired you as data science consultants. They want to supplement their exit interviews with a more proactive approach."],"metadata":{"id":"ijUmcNvS3ZNs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","<a name = Section2></a>\n","# **2.
